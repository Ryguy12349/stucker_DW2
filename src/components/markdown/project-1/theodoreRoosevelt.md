#### Theodore Roosevelt • 1858 to 1919 • Pragmatism / Practical Philosophy

 Roosevelt’s words cut through excuses. We often wait for the perfect tools, the right timing, or more resources before starting. But life rarely provides perfect conditions. Strength comes from making progress with what is at hand, no matter how small. This philosophy pushes us toward adaptability and resilience: what matters is not the ideal starting point, but the courage to begin.
