#### G.K. Chesterton • 1874 to 1936 • Christian Philosophy / Literary Philosophy

 Chesterton’s words confront the perfectionist within us. Too often, we avoid action because we fear failure or imperfection. But in truth, mastery is built upon countless clumsy beginnings. To do something badly is not a waste — it is the first stage of learning. This perspective frees us to try, experiment, and stumble without shame, knowing that the act of doing itself is valuable. What might I attempt if I released the need for immediate excellence?
