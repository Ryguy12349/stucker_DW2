####  Marcus Aurelius • 121 to 180 CE • Stoic Philosophy

 Aurelius reminds us that mortality itself should not terrify us, for death is natural and inevitable. The greater tragedy lies in letting fear, hesitation, or distraction keep us from truly living. To begin living is to act with purpose, to align with our values, and to experience the fullness of life. Reflection here asks: what parts of life am I delaying, and how might I choose to live more boldly today?
